These example emails all use Responsive Web Design techniques to alter the width, margins, and/or layout depending on the window/preview pane width. While viewing the index.html files in a browser you can resize your browser window to see the Responsive behavior. 

1-column-fixed
- This 1 column layout has 3 different fixed widths then removes vertical margins on the narrowest screens. 


1-column-fixed-fluid
- This simple 1 column layout uses a fixed width on wider screens then changes to a fluid (100%) width on narrower screens.


2-column-combined
- This 2 column layout becomes a 1 column layout on narrower screens. Some of the content is fixed width while other content is fluid (100%) width. This particular email was not required to be responsive, but some basic responsive techniques were added for user/mobile-friendliness.
